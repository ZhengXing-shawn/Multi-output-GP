# Multi-output-GP
Multi-output Gaussian Process

This project could be used for solving both spatial-temporal problem/dynamic problem and multi-output problem.

Based on Conti S, Oâ€™Hagan A. Bayesian emulation of complex multi-output and dynamic computer models[J]. Journal of statistical planning and inference, 2010, 140(3): 640-651.
