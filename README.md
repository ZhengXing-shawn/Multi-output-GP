# Multi-output-GP
Multi-output Gaussian Process

This project could be used for solving both spatial-temporal problem/dynamic problem and multi-output problem.

Based on Conti S, Oâ€™Hagan A. Bayesian emulation of complex multi-output and dynamic computer models[J]. Journal of statistical planning and inference, 2010, 140(3): 640-651.

### The code usage:
1. Download RichardPoFlow as the libraries to generate data.
2. Run Richard1dDataGen_Script and save generated data.
3. Run DEMO_mogp files at root for demonstrations.

**The code is still under development.**

### Demo result short-view
The demo uses 350 sets of training data to optimise parameter r, then predicts the test data and compares the result with the origin data in both spatial-temporal map and uncertainty quantification(UQ) map.
